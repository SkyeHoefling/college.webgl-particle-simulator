## Coding Standards ##

Good coding standards shall be followed for this project.  The only exception is quick proof of concepts which will be extracted into a separate folder so it isn't confused with the rest of the project.

### Folders ###
#### Folder Hierarchy ####

The project shall be set up as a library that is easy to use and extract.  Following these simple guidelines will allow the project to be expandable.
  * Every system or big object should be extracted into it's own system.  For example: there will be a water folder separate from a fire folder.
  * There will be proper sub-folders.  A sub-folder will use items from the super folder.  Example: A water shader folder, and water physics folder will be a sub-folder in the water folder

#### Folder Naming Conventions ####

  * Folder names will use a camel based naming convention.
  * All folders will start with a capital letter.
  * Example: ThisIsAFolderName
